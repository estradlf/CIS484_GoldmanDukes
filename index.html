    <h1>Story Analyzer User and Analysis Management System: Statement of Work</h1>
    <h2>Prepared by Team: Goldman Dukes</h2>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>Goldman Dukes aims to provide a Story Analyzer User and Analysis Management System to our client, Dr. Mike Mitri, and his product, Story Analyzer. Story Analyzer is an app that helps users take text and conceptualizes it through data visualization with the use of natural language process (NLP). Our deliverable will be an information system to support the Story Analyzer Project through the integration of a management system to capture the text analysis and extraction within Story Analyzer.</p>
      <p>The scope of the work will overall be an information system available on Amazon Web Service (AWS) that includes deliverables such as a Microsoft SQL Server Database and user interface through Visual Studio. The database will collect all appropriate data for the user and their story analysis. Through Visual Studio, we will create a website utilizing webforms to contribute to the user software interface.</p> 
    <h3>Project Goals</h3>
      <p>Our major goals are to produce an easy-to-use, functional software interface and database that exceeds client expectations, while conducting constant team communications, and that overall wins the capstone. By working with the client, we will create a system where implementation will be smooth, user friendly, and operates efficiently and effectively for the client and all users.</p>
    <h3>Obstacles/Potential Technical Issues</h3>
      <p>For the foreseeable issues, we find that scheduling meetings and being able to all collaborate on the same system to be our main two issues. Ideally, we would have most members present, but by communicating utilizing our Communication Method Matrix, we can mitigate any scheduling issues. For collaborating, we plan to use GitHub and Microsoft Teams, but with both systems there is a learning curve.</p>
    <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>Our target user for the system would be anyone that primarily deals with copious amounts of texts and the analysis of texts. Specific target careers might be researchers, journalists, the legal community, and historians. Although all users are welcomed, we have targeted our system to fit the needs of those who absorb lots of information through texts.</p>
    <h3>Timeline</h3>
      <p>Currently, our timeline is based off the sprint schedules, which occur on October 5th, October 19th, November 11th, and November 30th. Utilizing those hard deadlines, we have set soft completion dates to have deliverables accomplished approximately four days prior. This allows our team to review and edit deliverables and prepare for sprint reviews. Throughout each sprint, we plan to establish more specific dates for each team member based on the establishment of work.</p>
